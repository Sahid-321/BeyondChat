## 🔧 Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create `.env` file with the following variables:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/beyondchat
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd beyondchat
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### Database Setup

1. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or provide a cloud MongoDB URI
2. The application will automatically create the necessary collections on first run

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Upload PDFs**: Start by uploading your coursebook PDFs on the dashboard
2. **Select Source**: Choose between all PDFs or a specific PDF for context
3. **Generate Quizzes**: Create different types of questions (MCQ/SAQ/LAQ) based on your materials
4. **Take Quizzes**: Answer questions and get detailed feedback with explanations
5. **Chat with AI**: Ask questions about your study materials and get contextual answers with citations
6. **Track Progress**: Monitor your learning journey and identify strengths/weaknesses
